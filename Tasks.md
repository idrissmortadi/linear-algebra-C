# Project Idea: Implement a Linear Algebra Library in C

## **Project Overview:**
Create a C library that handles fundamental linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, inversion, and solving linear systems. This library will be the backbone for implementing basic machine learning algorithms in the future.

## **Project Objectives:**
1. Deepen your understanding of C programming, particularly in memory management, pointers, and efficient computation.
2. Gain hands-on experience with mathematical concepts in linear algebra.
3. Lay the groundwork for more complex AI-related projects.

## **Project Breakdown:**

1. **Setup and Basic Data Structures:**
   - **Task:** Create a `Matrix` data structure.
   - **Details:** Define a `Matrix` structure that holds matrix data and its dimensions (rows, columns). Include functions to create, initialize, and free matrices.
   - **Expected Output:** Ability to create matrices, set values, and print them.

2. **Matrix Operations:**
   - **Task:** Implement basic matrix operations.
   - **Details:** Implement functions for matrix addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.
   - **Expected Output:** Perform and validate basic operations on matrices.

3. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - **Task:** Implement matrix multiplication.
   - **Details:** Write a function that multiplies two matrices and handles edge cases (e.g., dimension mismatches).
   - **Expected Output:** Perform matrix multiplication and return the resulting matrix.

4. **Matrix Transposition:**
   - **Task:** Implement matrix transposition.
   - **Details:** Write a function to transpose a given matrix.
   - **Expected Output:** Return the transpose of any matrix.

5. **Matrix Determinant and Inversion:**
   - **Task:** Implement determinant calculation and matrix inversion.
   - **Details:** Use recursive algorithms for determinants and Gaussian elimination for matrix inversion.
   - **Expected Output:** Compute determinants and inverses of square matrices.

6. **Solving Linear Systems:**
   - **Task:** Implement a function to solve linear systems using Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition.
   - **Details:** Write a function that solves `Ax = b` for a given matrix `A` and vector `b`.
   - **Expected Output:** Provide solutions to linear systems, returning the vector `x`.

7. **Error Handling and Optimization:**
   - **Task:** Improve your code with error handling and optimizations.
   - **Details:** Add checks for common errors (e.g., division by zero, non-square matrices) and optimize the code for performance.
   - **Expected Output:** A robust library with proper error handling and efficient computation.

8. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - **Task:** Document your code and create test cases.
   - **Details:** Write comments and documentation for your library functions. Develop test cases to validate the correctness of your functions.
   - **Expected Output:** Clear documentation and a suite of test cases.

9. **Extended Challenge (Optional):**
   - **Task:** Implement basic machine learning algorithms.
   - **Details:** Use your linear algebra library to implement simple algorithms like linear regression or k-means clustering.
   - **Expected Output:** Working machine learning algorithms built on your library.

## **Deliverables:**
1. Complete C source code for the linear algebra library.
2. A README file with usage instructions.
3. Test cases to demonstrate the correctness of your library.
4. (Optional) Basic machine learning algorithms using your library.
